 * Quick Overview
 * ==============
 *
 * The core IO library follows an evented design and uses callbacks for IO
 * events. Using the API described in the Connection Callback (Protocol)
 * Management section:
 *
 * - Each connection / socket, is identified by a process unique number
 *   (`uuid`).
 *
 * - Connections are assigned protocol objects (`fio_protocol_s`) using the
 *   `fio_attach` function.
 *
 * - The callbacks in the protocol object are called whenever an IO event
 *   occurs.
 *
 * - Callbacks are protected using one of two connection bound locks -
 *   `FIO_PR_LOCK_TASK` for most tasks and `FIO_PR_LOCK_WRITE` for `on_ready`
 *   and `ping` tasks.
 *
 * - User data is assumed to be stored in the protocol object using C style
 *   inheritance.
 *
 * Reading and writing operations use an internal user-land buffer and they
 * never fail... unless, the client is so slow that they appear to be attacking
 * the network layer (slowloris), the connection was lost due to other reasons
 * or the system is out of memory.
 *
 * Because the framework is evented, there's API that offers easy event and task
 * scheduling, including timers etc'. Also, connection events can be
 * rescheduled, allowing connections to behave like state-machines.
 *
 * The core library includes Pub/Sub (publish / subscribe) services which offer
 * easy IPC (inter process communication) in a network friendly API. Pub/Sub
 * services can be extended to synchronize with external databases such as
 * Redis.

Listening to Incoming Connections
===

Listening to incoming connections is pretty straight forward.

After a new connection is accepted, the `on_open` callback is called. `on_open`
should allocate the new connection's protocol and call `fio_attach` to attach
the protocol to the connection's uuid.

The protocol's `on_close` callback is expected to handle any cleanup required.

The following is an example echo server using facil.io:

```c
#include <fio.h>

// A callback to be called whenever data is available on the socket
static void echo_on_data(intptr_t uuid, fio_protocol_s *prt) {
  (void)prt; // we can ignore the unused argument
  // echo buffer
  char buf[1024] = {'E', 'c', 'h', 'o', ':', ' '};
  ssize_t len;
  // Read to the buffer, starting after the "Echo: "
  while ((len = fio_read(uuid, buf + 6, 1018)) > 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Read: %.*s", (int)len, buf + 6);
    // Write back the message
    fio_write(uuid, buf, len + 6);
    // Handle goodbye
    if ((buf[6] | 32) == 'b' && (buf[7] | 32) == 'y' &&
        (buf[8] | 32) == 'e') {
      fio_write(uuid, "Goodbye.\n", 9);
      fio_close(uuid);
      return;
    }
  }
}

// A callback called whenever a timeout is reach
static void echo_ping(intptr_t uuid, fio_protocol_s *prt) {
  (void)prt; // we can ignore the unused argument
  fio_write(uuid, "Server: Are you there?\n", 23);
}

// A callback called if the server is shutting down...
// ... while the connection is still open
static uint8_t echo_on_shutdown(intptr_t uuid, fio_protocol_s *prt) {
  (void)prt; // we can ignore the unused argument
  fio_write(uuid, "Echo server shutting down\nGoodbye.\n", 35);
